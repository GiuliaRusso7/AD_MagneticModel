# AD_MagneticModel
Data analysis of AD magnets to calculate magnets strenghts


## Step 1 (%% stands for the type of magnet you're considering):
In each magnet type folder you will find 2 codes:
  1) AnalysisMagneticMeasurements_AD_%% is the FIRST ONE to be run. It will take the data, analyse them and give in output the strenghts as a function of current
  2)  AD_%%_FromCurrent_ToAngle_Viceversa is the SECOND ONE to be run. For a given input value of current or strenght will provide in output the strenghts or the current, respectively.
